## 🎯 Features in Detail

### Lead Scoring Model
**How it works:**
- Analyzes 6 weighted factors:
  1. Engagement Score (25%) - Based on interaction count
  2. Budget Alignment (20%) - How budget matches offerings
  3. Response Time (15%) - Speed of lead response
  4. Interaction Frequency (15%) - Recent contact patterns
  5. Source Quality (15%) - Lead source reliability
  6. Timing Score (10%) - Seasonal factors

**Output:**
- Score: 0-100
- Category: Hot (80+), Warm (60-79), Cold (40-59), Ice Cold (<40)
- Conversion Probability: 10%-85%
- Actionable recommendations

**API Example:**
```bash
POST /api/ml/score-lead/
{
  "interaction_count": 5,
  "budget": 3000,
  "source": "whatsapp",
  "response_time_hours": 2.5
}

Response:
{
  "score": 75,
  "category": "warm",
  "conversion_probability": 0.60,
  "recommendations": [
    "Send detailed itinerary and customer testimonials"
  ]
}
```

### Churn Prediction Model
**How it works:**
- Analyzes customer behavior:
  1. Days since last booking (40 points)
  2. Booking frequency (30 points)
  3. Satisfaction score (30 points)

**Output:**
- Risk Score: 0-100
- Risk Level: High (70+), Medium (45-69), Low (<45)
- Churn Probability: 20%-80%
- Re-engagement recommendations

**API Example:**
```bash
POST /api/ml/predict-churn/
{
  "customer_id": 456
}

Response:
{
  "risk_score": 65,
  "risk_level": "medium",
  "churn_probability": 0.50,
  "recommendations": [
    "Send re-engagement campaign with new destinations",
    "Offer 10% loyalty discount"
  ]
}
```

### Revenue Forecasting Model
**How it works:**
- Analyzes pipeline data:
  1. Total pipeline value
  2. Historical conversion rate
  3. Seasonal factors

**Output:**
- Expected revenue
- 80% confidence interval (upper/lower bounds)
- Deals count and average deal size

**API Example:**
```bash
GET /api/ml/forecast-revenue/

Response:
{
  "expected_revenue": 28750.50,
  "confidence_interval": {
    "lower": 24000.00,
    "upper": 33500.00,
    "confidence_level": 80
  },
  "pipeline_value": 115000.00,
  "conversion_rate": 25.0,
  "deals_count": 15
}
```

### Sentiment Analysis Model
**How it works:**
- Keyword-based sentiment analysis
- Positive keywords: amazing, excellent, great, wonderful, etc.
- Negative keywords: terrible, awful, bad, disappointing, etc.

**Output:**
- Score: -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)
- Label: Positive, Neutral, Negative
- Confidence: 0.6-0.95

**API Example:**
```bash
POST /api/ml/analyze-sentiment/
{
  "text": "I had an amazing experience! The trip was fantastic."
}

Response:
{
  "score": 0.85,
  "label": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "positive_indicators": 2,
  "negative_indicators": 0
}
```

### Dynamic Pricing Model
**How it works:**
- Adjusts pricing based on:
  1. Demand (booking count)
  2. Seasonality (high/medium/low)
  3. Time until departure

**Output:**
- Recommended price
- Price change percentage
- Adjustment breakdown
- Expected conversion impact

**API Example:**
```bash
POST /api/ml/recommend-price/
{
  "package_id": 789,
  "seasonality": "high",
  "days_until_departure": 45
}

Response:
{
  "recommended_price": 3150.00,
  "base_price": 2500.00,
  "price_change": 26.0,
  "adjustments": {
    "high_demand": "+15%",
    "peak_season": "+20%"
  },
  "expected_conversion_impact": "↓ 13.0%"
}
```
